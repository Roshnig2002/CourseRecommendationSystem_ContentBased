# CourseRecommendationSystem_ContentBased
This project implements a content-based course recommendation system using the Udemy courses dataset. The system allows users to input any course title, and it then recommends the top 10 similar courses based on content features.
The system extracts relevant features from course descriptions, titles, and other attributes. Users can input a course title to receive personalized recommendations.
